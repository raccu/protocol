\section{Reset credentials}
In this section a flow for resetting credentials in case a user looses his/hers
smartphone or no longer has access to it is defined. 

    \subsection{Flow}
    The reset credentials flow is given in Figure~\ref{fig:resetCredentials} and defined as follows:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Mobile MUST request a verification code from the Auth by submitting the email address of the user
                  which is seeking a credentials reset.
            \item Upon receiving a reset credentials request, the Auth MUST dispatch an email with the verification
                  code to the Email.
            \item When the user enters verification code into the Mobile, the Mobile MUST provide a method to generate,
                  store, and retrieve public key and an interface for signing an arbitrary message with the matching 
                  private key.
            \item Mobile MUST send user's email, newly generated public key, and the signature of those two parameters
                  with a REQUIRED addition of the verification code to the Auth.
            \item Auth MUST return the user's name to the Mobile to finish the credentials reset.
        \end{enumerate}
