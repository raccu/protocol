\section{Register}
In the current version of the protocol, only an email-based registration is described in details, although 	
other types of verification claims can be easily added, if needed. However, to provide backwards compatibility,
other flows are required to obtain user's name and email address in addition to any information they acquire.

      \subsection{Register via email}
      The flow of registering an account via email (i.e. using an email verification claim) is shown in 
      Figure~\ref{fig:registerViaEmail} on page~\pageref{fig:registerViaEmail} and is defined as follows:
      \begin{enumerate}
            \item A user MUST provide a valid name and a valid email.
            \item When Auth receives a valid registration request, email containing the verification code MUST 
                  be dispatched to the provided email address.
            \item Upon receiving the verification code and entering it into the Mobile, the Mobile MUST provide 
                  a method to generate, store, and retrieve public key and an interface for signing an arbitrary 
                  message with the matching private key.
            \item Mobile MUST authenticate the user locally by using a built-in biometry. Upon authenticating, 
                  the Mobile MUST finish an account creation by submitting a name, email, generated public key, 
                  and a digital signature of all of the previous parameters, with a REQUIRED addition of the 
                  verification code, to the Auth.
      \end{enumerate}  
      \input{diagrams/sequence/registration-via-email.tex}           
      
            \subsubsection{Successful registration}
            If the registration via email is successful, the Mobile MUST remember user's name, email, public key, and 
            have access to the procedure that signs an arbitrary message with the matching private key. The Auth MUST 
            remember user's name, email, and public key.

            \subsubsection{Unsuccessful registration}
            If the registration via email fails for any reason related to the semantics of the protocol, an attempt to
            register MUST be discarded and all of the related data should be deleted. It is RECOMMENDED to log an attempt
            in order to screen a source of multiple invalid requests. All of the following reasons are considered to be
            a semantic of the protocol:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Email is already associated with another account.
                  \item Verification code entered into Mobile does not match the expected verification code.
                  \item The signature cannot be verified by a given public key.
                  \item The signature is invalid.
            \end{itemize}
            If the registration fails for any other reason (e.g. network outage), an appropriate message SHOULD be
            dispatched or left to other protocols for handling, should they offer such capability.
